    abstract = {{Benchmark problems should be hard. True. Methods for solving problems should be useful for more than just  ” beating” a particular benchmark. Truer still, we believe. In this paper, we examine the worthiness of the approach consisting of concentration on a particular set of benchmark problems, an issue raised by a recent paper by Ian Gent. We find that such a methodology can easily lead to publications of limited general use as far as our ability to solve practical problems is concerned.}},
